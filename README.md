Reliant
=======

Reliant is a Dependency Injection ([DI](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html "Martin Fowler never lies")) 
framework for Objective-C, both for OS X and iOS. Its goal is to make it's use as simple
as possible, while not limiting it's possibilities. It aims to have as little impact as
possible on your project code. It also aims to be loyal to Objective-C's [dynamic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/125367/dynamic-type-languages-versus-static-type-languages) 
nature.

The motivation for this library came from being used to a highly testable infrastructure
in other languages thanks to DI. Looking at the typical design pattern to solve the loose
coupling problem, the [Abstract Factory pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern)
is the natural solution. Although factories, in conjunction with mock libraries provide a
fairly nice and testable solution, the pure loose coupling is never reached, since you
still have a dependency to a factory in almost all classes in your project, which is a
rather large footprint. Before starting this library, I looked for opinions about DI in
dynamic languages at the one hand, and in frontend driven solutions at the other hand.
Reliant is an answer to these questions.

    At the moment, Reliant is still under development, and put here for review by the
    community. Although we consider the latest version to be pretty complete, there is
    still room for improvement. Obviously, since this is open source, do feel free to add
    your own insights/ideas/remarks/opinions.

Overall architecture
--------------------

The framework is set up to be lightweight, you basically need an OCSApplicationContext
which serves as the container of the managed objects. To register managed objects in this
container, the application context uses an `OCSConfigurator` instance. The `OCSConfigurator`
is responsible for creating `OCSDefinitions`, which describe the objects you want to put
under the application context's control.

At the moment, Reliant identifies two types of objects: singletons and prototypes. (*These
names are taken from the well know [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern#Classification_and_list)*)

- A `singleton` is a stateless shared object, which is created only once. Objects created as
singleton should be thread safe! Reliant further identifies eager and lazy singletons.
Eager means that they will be instantiated when the application context boots up, lazy
means they will be instantiated *Just-in-Time*, when they are requested.

    For iOS, Reliant also reacts to memory warnings, by clearing it's  singleton scope. In
    this case, all singletons become lazy singletons and will be initialized again when
    requested.

- A `prototype` will be created each time it is requested from the application context. Be
carefull though! If you inject a prototype into a singleton, the prototype's livecycle is
bound to the singleton!

Objects are identified by a key and can have aliases, both strings. The framework makes
sure these are unique. Exceptions will be thrown if an attempt is made to add an object
with a non-unique key or alias.

Now let's look at a Quick start example.

Quick start
-----------

### Including Reliant in your project

A ready made package of the last stable build is available on Reliant's GitHub 
[Downloads](https://github.com/mikeseghers/Reliant/downloads) section (`Reliant
vX.Y.zip`). Download the zip file. Inside it, you will find a directory for iOS, one for
OS X and a Docs directory with the Reliant DocSet in it. Depending on what you need, you
should do the following:

#### iOS

Move the iOS contents to you library folder (eg. ~/Library/Developer/libs). The static
library must be added to the application target in the `Link Binaries With Libraries`
build phase. Click the (+) icon, choose `Add other...` and locate the library in the just
extracted library.

Next you also need to add a `Header Search Path` in the build settings of you application
target (the Library Search Path should have been updated automatically by Xcode after the
previous step). Go to your target's Build Settings and search for Header. Locate the
`Header Search Paths`. Double click it and add a line by clicking the (+) button. Enter
the search path (eg. ~/Library/Developer/libs).

    If you are collaborating with others on your project, everyone should have the same
    path, as these settings are global. (I couldn't find another way, so if you do, please
    let us know!)

Goto the [static library documentation](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/Xcode/Conceptual/ios_development_workflow/AA-Developing_a_Static_Library_and_Incorporating_It_in_Your_Application/archiving_an_application_that_uses_a_static_library.html) for more options.

#### OS X

For Cocoa projects you move the framework folder to /Library/Frameworks. 

Add the framework to your project. Go to your application's target settings and go to
Build Phases. Select the `Link Binaries With Libraries` build phase. Click the (+) icon,
choose `Add other...` and locate Reliant.framework (if you restart Xcode after copying the
framework, you should directly find it in the proposed list).

There are other ways to install frameworks. Check the [framework documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Frameworks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000183-SW1).

#### General
    
Now you are ready to import the headers in your own code:

```objective-c
#import <Reliant/OCSApplicationContext.h>
```
#### The DocSet

In order to use the DocSet within Xcode, you should copy it to
/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets. After copying, you should restart Xcode.
If you then open the organizer, and go to the Documentation tab, you should see Reliant as
one of the documentation bundles.


    This DocSet also includes information about non-visible classes. This information is
    meant for collaborators on Reliant, you should not rely on these classes, categories
    and methods, as they might change in the future. Only use Reliant's publicly available
    headers in your own projects.

### Bootstrapping Reliant

To get started with Reliant, you need to tell the *OCSApplicationContext* to start up. You
will need to provide a configurator instance to the application context. More on
configurators later, bare with us for now.

```objective-c
//Initialize a configurator
id<OCSConfigurator> configurator = [[OCSConfiguratorFromClass alloc] 
	initWithClass:[YourObjectFactory class]];

//Initialize the application context with the configurator
OCSApplicationContext *context = [[OCSApplicationContext alloc] 
	initWithConfigurator:configurator];

//Start the context
[context start];

//Done! Well...
```

This will bootstrap the entire application context. At the time the start method finishes
it's job, it will have loaded your defintions and it will have instantiated and injected
your eager singletons.

Now where should you put this peace of code? As close as possible to where the application
startup. For iOS this means in the [application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) 
method in your UIApplicationDelegate. For OS X this is almost the same:
[applicationDidFinishLaunching:](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/NSApplicationDelegate/applicationDidFinishLaunching:)
 in your NSApplicationDelegate.
 
### Using the *OCSConfiguratorFromClass*

This is a ready-made configurator implementation. It uses the information found in a class
provided by you through introspection. The provided class will also serve as the creator
of your objects, hence we will call it a factory class. The idea behind this is to give
you a programatic way to define objects, and make the configuration itself subject to
testing. This makes the use of external configuration files and/or macros obsolete, which
yields more robust code.

So what you need to use this configurator is a factory class. The methods in this class
will be responsible for creating your objects. In order for the framework to detect these
methods, you will need to follow some naming conventions on them.

OCSConfiguratorFromClass will detect 4 kinds of methods. (Replace YourObjectKey each time with a unique name)

```objective-c
- (id) createSingleton/*YourObjectKey*/; //Lazy singleton definition
- (id) createEagerSingleton/*YourObjectKey*/; //Eager singleton definition
- (id) createPrototype/*YourObjectKey*/;//Prototype definition
- (NSArray *) aliasesFor/*YourObjectKey*/;//Alias definitions
```
Let's look at them in more detail:

#### Defining singletons

For each lazy singleton you need, you should add a method with the following signature:

```objective-c
- (id) createSingletonFoo {
	return [[[Foo alloc] init] autorelease];
}
```

You can also use what is called *constructor injection* by calling another 
*createSingleton* or *createEagerSingleton* method:

```objective-c
- (id) createSingletonBar {
	return [[[Bar alloc] initWithSomeObject:[self createSingletonFoo]] autorelease];
}
```

Don't worry about calling the same *createSingleton* method more then once, the framework
will only really call each method once and reuse the same result on the succeeding calls,
making the results true singletons.

You don't necessarily need to inject your objects through constructor injection. Later on
we will explain how objects are injected through the use of properties.

To create eager singletons, add this kind of method:

```objective-c
- (id) createEagerSingletonFooBar {
	return [[[FooBar alloc] init] autorelease];
}
```

#### Defining prototypes

For creating prototypes we can use a similar approach. Only the method name changes a bit:

```objective-c
- (id) createPrototypeFooBar {
	return [[[FooBar alloc] init] autorelease];
}
```

**Remember:** each time a prototype is requested, this method will be called. You should 
therefore consider to keep the initialization as performant as possible.

#### Registering aliases for an object

Registering aliases for an object is also possible. Again, you just need to add a method
with a certain signature:

```objective-c
- (NSArray *) aliasesForFoo {
	return [NSSet setWithObjects:@"_foo", @"_fuu", nil];
}
```

**Remark:** by default, two aliases are already registered for each object. They take the
form of the key in uppercase (eg. FOO, BAR, FOOBAR, ...) and the key starting with a
lowercase (eg. foo, bar, fooBar, ...). Aliases must be unique, and should also never be
equal to an object key. If an attempt is made to add a duplicate, an exception will be
raised. The automatically added aliases, will only be added if they are not a duplicate of
the key.

#### Other methods in your factory class

You can add other methods, which might help in creating your objects. These will be
ignored by the framework, but you can obviously use them in your create methods.

#### Dealing with larger applications

In larger applications, the factory class can quickly become huge. This is where you can
and should use Objective-C's
[category](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/conceptual/objectivec/chapters/occategories.html "Objective-C programming language reference")
mechanism. For each logical group of objects you can create a category, named after this
logical group. All methods in all categories of your factory class will be taken into
account. It might look something like this (interfaces will be omitted for brevity).

```objective-c
@implementation ReliantFactory

- (id) createSingletonGeneralObject {
	return ...;
}

@end

@implementation ReliantFactory (Services)

- (id) createEagerSingletonServiceA {
	return [[[ServiceA alloc] init] autorelease];
}

- (id) createEagerSingletonServiceB {
	return [[[ServiceB alloc] init] autorelease];
}

@end

@implementation ReliantFactory (Repositories)

- (id) createEagerSingletonRepositoryA {
	return [[[RepositoryA alloc] init] autorelease];
}

- (id) createEagerSingletonRepositoryB {
	return [[[RepositoryB alloc] init] autorelease];
}

@end

```

### Injection

All objects created in the application context will be injected after their creation. This
is done as explained before by *constructor injection* and/or by using Objective-C's 
[KVC](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/KeyValueCoding.html "Key-Value Coding Programming Guide")
mechanism. Reliant will scan your object's properties. If a writable property's name
matches with a key or alias for an object in the application context, and if it's current
value is nil, the matching object will be injected in this property. All other properties
will be left alone. This will be done for the entire class hierarchy of the instance.

#### Injecting objects that are not know to the application context

You can use the injection mechanism described above on objects which are not setup in the 
application context. A good example would be a UIViewController. In order to make things
easier, you can make use of the fact that we have bootstrapped our application context in
the UIApplicationDelegate. Since the UIApplication is a shared object (hey, another
singleton!) we can do our injection from here.

**Remark:** We already discussed that Reliant will clear it's singleton cache whenever a
memory warning occurs. Reliant thereby releases it's ownership of the instances. However,
it can not be held responsible for the objects injected outside of it's scope as discussed
above. You should therefore retain/release any injected objects yourself. For property injection,
this means that your dependent properties should have the retain attribute on it.

This is what you need to do:

```objective-c
//In your UIApplicationDelegate
@implementation MyAppDelegate {
	OCSApplicationContext *_context;
}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application 
	didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
	//...
	
	//Initialize a configurator
	id<OCSConfigurator> configurator = [[OCSConfiguratorFromClass alloc] 
		initWithClass:[YourObjectFactory class]];

	//Initialize the application context with the configurator
	_context = [[OCSApplicationContext alloc] initWithConfigurator:configurator];

	//Start the context
	[_context start];
	
	//...

}

- (void) performInjectionOn:(id) object {
	[_context performInjectionOn:object];
}

@end;

//In your UIViewController
@implementation MyViewController

@synthesize foo;

- (void) viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate *) [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
    [appDelegate performInjectionOn:self];
}

- (void) viewDidUnload {
	//Set any injected property to nil here!
	self.foo = nil
	
	[super viewDidUnload];
}

@end
```

And that's all there is to it. The property foo will be injected by Reliant.

### The configurator

As we already saw, a configurator is responsible for setting up definitions and creating
object instances based on those definitions. Although a default class configurator
(*OCSConfiguratorFromClass*) is provided by Reliant, you can always build your own. Your
custom configurator should conform to the *OCSConfigurator* protocol. In the
configurator's designated initializer, you should start building your object definitions.
A configurator, although not enforced, should maintain it's own definition registry. A
configurator should not start creating instances for these definitions just until the
contextLoaded: message is send to it. Only after all work is done should the configurator
return objects through its objectForKey:inContext: method. When work is done, the
initializing property should be true/YES/whatever-other-bool-literal-you-prefer.

An abstract implementation is also provided. This is the *OCSConfiguratorBase* which deals
with the boiler plate code for keeping track of registered definitions and object. If you
extend this class, you should import the *OCSConfiguratorBase+ForSubclassEyesOnly.h*
header in your implementation (.m file). This will alow you to call "protected" methods
and properties, hidden for non-extending classes. You should never use
this category outside of a subclass, doing so will cause unexpected behavior.

If you extend OCSConfiguratorBase, you should not override the methods defined in
OCSConfigurator. You must instead implement createObjectInstanceForKey:inContext: and
internalContextLoaded: (See API documentation for more information)

**Remark:** Although the framework is extendible, we encourage you to use the provided
OCSConfiguratorFromClass or extend via the OCSConfiguratorBase.

#### Example

```objective-c
//  CustomConfigurator.h

@interface CustomConfigurator : OCSBaseConfigurator

@end


// CustomConfigurator.m

TODO

@end
```

Inspirational projects / credits
--------------------------------

- [Spring framework](http://www.springsource.org/spring-framework#documentation "SpringSource Spring framework"). 
I dare say this is the de facto standard IoC container in the Java world. 
Although going much (much ... much) further then DI, this framework was one of if not the 
pioneer in DI framework. Since spring 3.0, a Configuration class system is available. Reliant
builds on this principle.

- [Guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/ "Google Guice"). Google's type safe DI 
solution. Partially as an answer to spring, which was not very strong on the type-safety 
side of things at that time. Spring fixed this in version 3.0.
Although Guice is a very well thought of DI framework, which should be marvelled for it's
simplicity and light-weightness, I personally feel that basing a DI framework for a
dynamic language on Guice is a bridge too far. It would break down too many of the main
goals of Guice, namely type safety. I'm not saying type safety is unimportant, I'm just
saying that Objective-C (and other dynamic languages for that matter) needs a different
approach.

- [Objection](http://objection-framework.org/ "AtomicObject Objection"). Another DI
framework for Objective-C, based on Guice. As stated before, the "binding" approach did
look appealing to me at first, but I don't think binding to types works very well in
Objective-C. But still, a very well made port.
